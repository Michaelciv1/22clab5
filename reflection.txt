Lab 5 Reflection
22C 

The main concepts that I covered while doing this lab were implementations of graphs and adjacency lists. In my head it was a lot easier to picture
how and adjacency list should work than it was to actually code it. Because this lab relied a lot on lists, I was able to reuse some of the code 
for printing lists from Lab 1. I didn't think to use anything else before I had already written code specifically for this lab. There was probably
more I could have drawn from and I'll keep that in mind in the future to look back at old work. I could have used and adjacency matrix for this graph,
but because there are so many gaps in the data making it less dense, it would have been very inefficient. The space complexity for the implementation
of this graph is O(V) with V representing verticies. The time complexity to search for a course is O(V + E) with E representing edges.
